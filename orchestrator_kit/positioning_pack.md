# ReplyByAI — Positioning Pack (Public Messaging)

**Where to use:** replybyai.com hero/subheads, LinkedIn/Twitter bios, ad headlines, niche LP headers.

## Taglines (A/B rotate)

- **Turn questions into checkouts.**
- **More sales, less support.**
- **Your 24/7 salesperson—on every product page.**

## 3‑Sentence Explainer (≤60 words)

ReplyByAI installs a conversion‑focused chatbot that answers product questions, captures emails, and nudges shoppers to buy. It learns your catalog, policies, and tone—then routes complex issues to you while handling the rest automatically. Stores see more purchases, fewer abandoned carts, and less time spent on repetitive support.

## Mini Case (anonymized; use as example)

A 7‑SKU skincare Shopify shop added ReplyByAI to PDPs and checkout: **+18%** add‑to‑cart, **+11%** checkout conversion, and **−32%** WISMO tickets in 30 days. Top plays—“shade finder,” “bundle builder,” and “shipping ETA”—drove **\$4.2k** assisted revenue. Owner workload dropped \~**3 hrs/week**.

> **Compliance note:** treat as illustrative; label “example” or “anonymized” unless client‑approved. Keep claims time‑boxed and conservative.

## Proof Points (reuse bullets)

- Trained on your **catalog, FAQs, and policies** in minutes.
- Built‑in plays: **back‑in‑stock capture, coupon handoff, UTM‑aware prompts**.
- **Human handoff** + transcripts in email/Slack; **no code** required.

## CTA blocks (short)

- **Get the Starter FAQ Pack** — 15 boutique FAQs + ≤60‑word answer patterns.
- **Start a 15‑min Fit Call** — map your FAQ → install → first KPI email in 7 days.
