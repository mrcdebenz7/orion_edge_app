## Week-1 Check-In Email Template

**Subject:** Week 1 results + next steps — [Store Name] AI Assistant  
**To:** `[client email]`  

```
Hi [Client First Name],

Thanks for piloting the AI assistant. Here’s your first-week snapshot:
• Interactions: {interactions}
• Resolution rate: {resolution_rate}%
• Leads captured (email opt-ins): {leads}
• Top topics: {topic_1}, {topic_2}, {topic_3}
• Top 3 unanswered to add: 1) {u1} 2) {u2} 3) {u3}

Quality & safety: No payment data collected in chat; unknowns routed to your inbox/Slack.

Proposed next steps (7 days):
1) Add the 3 answers above to the KB (we’ll draft + load).
2) Optional: enable Messenger fallback (free during trial).
3) Light A/B on greeting to lift self-serve clicks.

Pick a plan (below) and I’ll send an invoice + enable auto-reports.

Best,
[Your Name]
{BOOKING_URL} · {DEMO_URL}

## Referral Ask (Client-Forwardable)

> “We just finished a 7-day pilot for our tiny AI support widget and it cut repeat DMs while capturing leads. If you know a store that could use this, I’m happy to set up a no-cost demo this week: {BOOKING_URL}.”

Alt for direct ask:

> “Quick favor—if this bot saved you time, would you forward this to a peer? They get a 7-day trial and setup discount if they mention you. Want me to line up a short demo link?”

## Pass/Fail

- **PASS** if email template, pricing table, agreement bullets, invoice template, and referral prompt are ready.  
- **FAIL** otherwise.
