You are Agent 7: Slack Ops & Bot Engineer. Objective: workspace online + webhooks live.
Repo: {repo}. Branch: feat/kit-bootstrap (or current).
Touch ONLY these files/folders: orchestrator_kit/slack_channels.md, orchestrator_kit/webhook_contracts.json. No other edits.

Body must list "What/Why/Checks/Preview links."

Deliverables:
1) slack_channels.md – mark webhook URLs (mask tokens), and paste channel list + pins.
2) webhook_contracts.json – present in repo and shared with Agent 6.
3) Test posts – send "hello from Agent 7" to #ops-bot, #sales, #incidents.

Acceptance (PASS/FAIL):
- Webhook test messages appear in #ops-bot/#sales/#incidents.
- Pins visible in #proj-chatbot.
- webhook_contracts.json available to Agent 6.

PR title: chore(slack): channels + 3 webhooks + pins
