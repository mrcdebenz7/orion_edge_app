# Orion Intelligence Agency Launch — 05_sheets_setup.md

## Workbook Overview

Create a single Google Sheets workbook with the following tabs (Editor access for `automation@agency.com`):

1. **KB** – curated FAQ source of truth (columns: `id, question, answer, tags, product, priority, last_updated, approved_by`).
2. **Interactions** – log of every bot reply (schema below).
3. **Unknowns** – escalations sent to humans.
4. **Leads** – captured emails from the chatbot or landing pages.
5. **Weekly Summary** – per-client rollup for KPI Friday digest.

Restrict sharing to core agents; Zapier/Make connections should use service accounts only.

## Automation Specs (Zapier / Make)

### Zap A1 — Interactions Log (must-have)
- **Trigger:** Landbot or ManyChat new message/conversation.
- **Actions:** Formatter step to redact card/email patterns → Append Row to **Interactions** (A–K) → optional update to populate derived fields.

### Zap A2 — Unknown Ticket Escalation (must-have)
1. **Trigger:** ManyChat tag `unknown_needed` or fallback branch without KB match.  
2. **Rotate owner:** Look up last owner and alternate between `@agent2` / `@agent4`.  
3. **Slack Webhook:** Post to `#ops-bot` using the `unknown_event` schema (per `webhook_contracts.json`).  
4. **Append Row:** Write to **Unknowns** (A–L) including due date (`=WORKDAY(TODAY(),2)`).  
5. **Email:** Notify owner with transcript link; optionally add to **Leads** if email captured.

### Zap A3 — Lead Capture Sync (nice-to-have)
- **Trigger:** Interactions row with `email_captured=TRUE` or LP form submission.
- **Actions:** Normalize to lowercase, dedupe on `(client,email,7 days)`, append/update **Leads**.

### Zap A4 — Weekly KPI Roll-Up (Friday 09:00 PT)
- Compute week window, update **Weekly Summary** row per client.
- Generate digest via OpenAI using KPI prompt (below).
- Post `kpi_summary` payload to Slack `#analytics-kpi` and email stakeholders.

### Zap A5 — Ticket Resolution Close-Out (optional)
- **Trigger:** Unknowns `status` becomes `Resolved`.
- **Actions:** React in Slack thread, record `kb_row_url`, optionally append new FAQ to KB.

> Make.com equivalents: replace Gmail/Slack/Zap steps with HTTP modules; keep payload keys identical to `webhook_contracts.json`.

## Prompts for Automation Copy

### Weekly Summary Prompt
```
Summarize this conversation in 2 sentences for the store owner. Focus on the customer’s request, whether the KB answered it, and if human follow-up is needed. Do not include personal data. End with one clear next step. Max 45 words.
```

### KPI Email Prompt
```
Draft a weekly client report: assisted X customers, resolution rate Y%, top topics [a,b,c], leads Z, suggested new FAQs [list]. Keep to 120 words, friendly and factual.
```

## Pass/Fail Checklist

- Workbook created with all tabs and schemas above.  
- Zap A1 and Zap A2 tested end-to-end (rows appear, Slack and email fire).  
- Zap A4 scheduled and sends a Friday digest to Slack + email.  
- Prompts for weekly summary and KPI email stored alongside this doc.
