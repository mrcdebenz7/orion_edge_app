*PG overview for prospects. Clear steps, what’s included, and expectations—ready to export as PDF.*

**Legend:** **ANJ** = annotated note/justification tag to highlight why a step matters. If you use a different meaning for “ANJ,” tell me and I’ll switch the label.

## What it is (30‑sec)
A store‑branded assistant that answers pre‑purchase questions **24/7** on your site + IG/FB DMs. We start with **rules for accuracy**, add **AI fallback** for unknowns, and **handoff to a human** when needed. Result: **more carts, fewer tickets**. (ANJ: Rules → AI reduces off‑policy answers.)

---

## 7‑Day Launch Plan — exactly how we roll out
**Day 0–1 — Kickoff & Intake**  
• Connect channels: website chat + IG/FB DMs. *(ANJ: Go where your shoppers actually ask.)*  
• Gather top FAQs, policies (shipping/returns), brand tone. *(ANJ: Canonical answers = brand‑safe.)*  
• Pick tier (DIY/DFY/Premium) + set success targets. *(ANJ: Align on metrics up front.)*

**Day 2–3 — Build & Brand**  
• Preload flows for the big 6: Shipping, Returns, **Shade/Size/Dimensions**, Order Status, Restock. *(ANJ: 60–80% of tickets.)*  
• Configure **AI fallback** with guardrails + your tone. *(ANJ: Only when rules don’t match.)*  
• Set **human handoff + lead capture** (email/CRM). *(ANJ: No dead‑ends.)*

**Day 4–5 — QA & Staging**  
• Test on site + socials; response‑time targets: <2s rules, <5s AI. *(ANJ: SLA‑like UX goals.)*  
• Fix unknowns; tighten copy; confirm disclosures. *(ANJ: Privacy‑by‑design.)*  
• Embed on a **staging page**; you UAT before we go live. *(ANJ: Zero‑risk preview.)*

**Day 6–7 — Go Live & Learn**  
• Flip live; monitor early conversations. *(ANJ: Real shoppers = real tuning.)*  
• Weekly insights: top unknowns → new FAQs; prompt nips/tucks. *(ANJ: Continuous lift.)*  
• Optional add‑ons: order lookup, Slack alerts, WhatsApp. *(ANJ: Turn on as you grow.)*

## What you get (by plan)
| Plan | Setup | Monthly | What’s Included |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **DIY** | $300 | $75 | Core FAQ flows • Email capture • Monthly tune‑up |
| **DFY** | $600 | $200 | Custom flows • Order lookup • Weekly tune‑up |
| **Premium** | $1,200 | $400 | All DFY + multi‑channel (IG/FB) • Priority SLA |
*(ANJ: Even DIY covers the high‑impact flows; DFY/Premium add speed + breadth.)*

---

## What we need from you
• Admin access for chosen channels; a contact for approvals. *(ANJ: 1 point of contact = speed.)*  
• Links to policies + preferred tone examples. *(ANJ: Consistency beats creativity here.)*  
• Fast UAT feedback (one consolidated round). *(ANJ: Keeps timeline under a week.)*

---

## Privacy & Disclosures
The bot **identifies as AI**, avoids unnecessary PII, and routes to a human on request. Logs can be deleted on request; retention is configurable. *(ANJ: Trust by design.)*

---

## FAQ (top objections)
**How accurate is it?** Rules first; AI only when needed; handoff if unsure. *(ANJ)*  
**Will it match our voice?** Yes—brand tone is configured up front. *(ANJ)*  
**How do we measure ROI?** We track conversion lift, ticket deflection, and leads. *(ANJ)*
