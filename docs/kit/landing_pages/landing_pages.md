# Site Speed Pack Landing Page

**URL:** `replybyai.com/speed-pack`  
**Goal:** Lead magnet → Developer audience

### Hero Section

**Headline:**  
# Add an AI Chatbot Without Slowing Down Your Site

**Subheadline:**  
Lightweight widget (<15KB), async loading, zero impact on Core Web Vitals. Built for performance-obsessed devs.

**CTA Button:**  
[Get the Speed Pack] → Email capture

**Hero Image:**  
Lighthouse score 100/100 with chat widget visible

---

### The Developer Problem

You want to add a chatbot, but:
- ❌ Most widgets add 200KB+ bloat
- ❌ Blocking scripts kill page speed
- ❌ Third-party iframes tank Lighthouse scores
- ❌ Your boss says "make it instant" (but also "add more features")

**We built the Speed Pack to solve this.**

---

### What's Inside

📦 **Async Widget Loader** — 8KB, loads after page interactive  
⚡ **Edge-Optimized Backend** — <50ms API response time (Cloudflare Workers)  
📊 **Performance Budget** — Max 15KB total (widget + runtime)  
🧪 **Lighthouse CI Config** — Auto-test in GitHub Actions  
🔧 **Preload Strategies** — dns-prefetch, preconnect for bot API  

**Format:** GitHub repo + 10-page implementation guide (PDF)

---

### Benchmark Comparison

| Chatbot Solution | Widget Size | Load Time | Lighthouse Impact |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **ReplyByAI (Speed Pack)** | **12KB** | **42ms** | **0 points** |
| Intercom | 215KB | 890ms | -8 points |
| Drift | 178KB | 720ms | -6 points |
| Zendesk Chat | 312KB | 1,240ms | -12 points |

*Tested on 4G throttled connection, Moto G4 device*

### Technical Deep Dive

**Async Loading Pattern:**
```html
<script>
  (function(w,d){
    w.replyByAI=function(){w.replyByAI.q.push(arguments)};
    w.replyByAI.q=[];
    var s=d.createElement('script');
    s.async=true;
    s.src='https://cdn.replybyai.com/widget.min.js';
    d.head.appendChild(s);
  })(window,document);
  
  replyByAI('init', {botId: 'YOUR_BOT_ID'});
</script>
```

**Why This Is Fast:**
1. Inline loader (no external request)
2. Async script load (doesn't block rendering)
3. Widget lazy-loads after TTI (Time to Interactive)
4. Edge CDN (Cloudflare) = global <50ms latency

---

### Real-World Results
