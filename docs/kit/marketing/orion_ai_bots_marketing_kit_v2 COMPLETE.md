## Pain → Outcome (3 Cards)

### Card 1: Pain
**Icon:** Frustrated shopper emoji or line-icon of abandoned cart  
**Headline:** Shoppers bounce when questions go unanswered.  
**Body:** Every "Is this cruelty-free?" or "Will this fit a Golden Retriever?" left hanging is a lost sale. Live chat is slow. Email is too late. Static FAQs don't convert.

### Card 2: Bridge
**Icon:** Lightning bolt or chat bubble with checkmark  
**Headline:** Instant answers at the moment of decision.  
**Body:** Our rules-first engine pulls from your catalog, policies, and FAQ library in under 3 seconds. If confidence is low, AI reasons through it. Still unsure? Seamless human handoff.

### Card 3: Outcome
**Icon:** Graph trending up or shopping bag with dollar sign  
**Headline:** More carts, fewer tickets.  
**Body:** Chat-assisted visitors convert up to 4× more. Support volume drops ~30%. You capture emails even when they don't buy—fueling your retargeting flywheel.

**Visual Suggestion (all 3 cards):**  
Icon + headline in Orbitron; body in Inter; navy background with copper accent line beneath headline.  
**Alt text per card:** "Icon and headline describing [Pain/Bridge/Outcome] for e-commerce chatbot solution."

---

## How It Works (3 Steps, Horizontal Timeline or Vertical Stack)

### Step 1: Rules-First Lookup
**Icon:** Database or book icon  
**Body:** Bot checks your catalog, SKU table, FAQ doc, and policy sheet. 85% of queries resolve here—instant, accurate, zero hallucination.

### Step 2: AI Reasoning (Fallback)
**Icon:** Brain or neural-net icon  
**Body:** For nuanced questions ("Can I use this serum with retinol?"), GPT-4 reasons through your product descriptions and ingredient lists, flagged for confidence score.

### Step 3: Human Handoff
**Icon:** Headset or hand-wave icon  
**Body:** Bot says "Let me connect you with the team" when confidence is low. Smooth transition; full chat history passed to your support tool (Gorgias, Zendesk, Slack).

**Visual Suggestion:**  
Numbered circles in copper gradient; connecting dotted line in light gray; icons above each circle; text below.  
**Alt text:** "Three-step workflow showing rules-first lookup, AI reasoning fallback, and human handoff for Orion chatbot."

### E3: Gentle Nudge (Trigger: 3 Days After E2, If No Reply)

**Subject A:** Quick Q: What's holding you back?  
**Subject B:** Still thinking? Let me answer your top concern.

**Preview Line:**  
No pressure. Just checking in.

**Body:**

Hi {{First_Name}},

Wanted to check in. I know you're busy.

**Common concerns I hear:**
1. "We're not sure our FAQ is ready." → We can draft it for you (DFY plan).
2. "Will this work with our platform?" → Yes (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Wix, custom).
3. "What if the bot gives wrong answers?" → Rules-first = zero hallucination on 85% of queries. AI fallback flagged for confidence. You approve flows before launch.

**Which one resonates?** Reply and I'll address it specifically.

Or if you're ready to roll, just say "Let's go" and we'll start Day 0.

Best,  
Dan

### E4: Final Value Touch (Trigger: 5 Days After E3, If No Reply)

**Subject A:** Last note: Your chatbot could be live by next Friday.  
**Subject B:** I'll close your file unless I hear back.

**Preview Line:**  
7-day launch. 4× conversion. 30% fewer tickets.

**Body:**

Hi {{First_Name}},

This is my last check-in (promise!).

**Quick math:**  
- If you're doing $50K/mo in revenue...
- And chat-assisted visitors convert at 4× the rate (conservative: 2.8×)...
- That's $20K+ in incremental revenue per month.
- Cost: $200/mo (DFY) or $400/mo (Premium).
- ROI: 100× or more.

**If I don't hear back, I'll assume timing isn't right and close your file.**

But if you're ready: reply "Let's go" and we'll kick off Day 0 tomorrow.

Cheers,  
Dan

P.S. No hard feelings if it's not a fit. If timing changes, my door's always open.

## OUTBOUND SEQUENCE (Cold Prospects)

### O1: Cold Introduction (Trigger: Manual Send or Automated List)

**Subject A:** Quick Q: How do you handle "{{Sample_Question}}" right now?  
**Subject B:** {{First_Name}}, saw your {{Vertical}} store—can we chat?

**Preview Line:**  
15-min demo. No pitch. Just showing you how we answer {{Sample_Question}} in 3 sec.

**Body:**

Hi {{First_Name}},

I run Orion Intelligence Agency. We build AI chatbots for {{Vertical}} brands like yours.

**Saw your store.** Gorgeous work. Quick question:

**How do you handle "{{Sample_Question}}" right now?**  
(e.g., "What's my shade?" for Beauty, "Will this fit my dog?" for Pets, "Will this fit my patio?" for Home & Garden)

Most stores we talk to say:
- Live chat is too slow.
- Static FAQs don't convert.
- Support tickets pile up.

**We solve this in 3 seconds:**  
Bot checks your catalog + FAQ → answers instantly → captures email → escalates to human if unsure.

**Results:** Up to 4× conversion from chat. ~30% fewer support hours.

**Want a 15-min demo?** No pitch. Just show you how it works for {{Vertical}}. [Book here.](#)

### O2: Value Case Study (Trigger: 3 Days After O1, If No Reply)

**Subject A:** How [Similar Store] got 4× conversion in 30 days  
**Subject B:** Case study: {{Vertical}} brand cut support hours by 30%

**Preview Line:**  
Real numbers. Real results. 3-min read.

**Body:**

Hi {{First_Name}},

No reply to my last note—totally fine, I know you're busy.

Thought you might find this useful regardless:

**Case: [Beauty Brand Name] (made-up example for illustration; replace with real case when available)**
- Problem: "What's my shade?" questions flooded support. Static shade chart didn't convert.
- Solution: Orion AI bot with photo-match tool. Live in 6 days.
- Results (Day 30):
  - Chat-assisted conversion: **+47%**
  - Support tickets: **-33%**
  - Email capture rate: **52%**

**Why it worked:**
1. Rules-first lookup (SKU table, ingredient list) = zero hallucination.
2. AI fallback for nuanced Qs ("Can I use this with retinol?").
3. Human handoff when confidence < 70%.

**Want to see it in action for {{Vertical}}?** [Book a 15-min demo.](#)

**Quick math:**

- Cost: $200/mo (DFY) or $400/mo (Premium).

We chatted {{X_Days_Ago}} days ago about your {{Vertical}} store + AI chatbot for {{Sample_Question}}.

**Anything change?**  
- Maybe you launched a new product line?
- Or support tickets are piling up again?
- Or you're gearing up for Q4 / holiday season?

**If timing is better now:** [Book a quick 15-min demo.](#)

### R2: New Feature Announcement (Trigger: New Feature Launch or Quarterly Update)

**Subject A:** New: Multi-channel chatbot (IG + FB Messenger)  
**Subject B:** Update: We just added {{New_Feature}} to Premium plan

**Preview Line:**  
Same bot. More channels. Capture leads everywhere.

**Body:**

Hi {{First_Name}},

Quick update: we just launched **multi-channel support** for Premium plan customers.

**What's new:**
- Same bot logic on Instagram DM + Facebook Messenger.
- Unified admin dashboard (view all chats in one place).
- Email capture works across all channels → syncs to Klaviyo/Mailchimp/HubSpot.

**Why this matters for {{Vertical}}:**  
Your shoppers are DMing you on IG anyway ("What's my shade?" / "Will this fit?"). Now the bot handles it instantly—just like on your site.

**Interested?** [Book a 15-min demo.](#) Or reply if you have questions.

**Subject B:** Final offer: DFY plan for DIY price (this month only).

**Preview Line:**  
$200 off setup. Expires {{Expiry_Date}}.

**Body:**

Hi {{First_Name}},

I know we've chatted a few times and timing hasn't been right. Totally get it.

**One last offer:**  
- **$200 off setup** (normally $600 for DFY → now $400).
- Or **DFY plan for DIY price** ($75/mo instead of $200/mo for first 3 months).
- Expires **{{Expiry_Date}}**.

**Why now?**  
We're beta-testing a new {{Feature_Name}} feature and need 5 more {{Vertical}} brands to join. You'd get priority access + this discount.

**Interested?** Reply "Yes" or [book here.](#)

**Not interested?** Reply "Close my file" and I'll stop reaching out (no hard feelings).

Best,  
Dan

P.S. Offer expires {{Expiry_Date}}. After that, it's back to standard pricing.
